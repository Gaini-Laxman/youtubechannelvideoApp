        <h3>Introduction to Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in software development. It was designed to have the "write once, run anywhere" capability, which means that once you write a Java program, it can run on any machine that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</p>

        <h3>Core Java Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Learn how to declare variables and understand the different data types such as int, float, char, and boolean.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Understand conditional statements like if-else, switch, and loops such as for and while.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Master the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> Learn how to handle errors in your Java programs using try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your First Java Program</h3>
        <p>Below is an example of a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:</p>

        <p>Save this code with a <strong>.java</strong> extension, compile it using the Java compiler, and run the program to see the output.</p>

        <h3>Java Tutorials (Video)</h3>
        <p>Here are some tutorial videos to help you get started with Java:</p>
